# Bayesian Bearings
Project for my Bayesian Computation model, looking at predicting viewpoint locations using bearings and then using Bayesian analysis to compute and visualise the uncertainty in those predictions. Finally applying hypothetical additional prior knowledge to show understanding of Bayesian concepts and generate some cool maps.
