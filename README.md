# Bayesian Bearings
Project for my Bayesian Computation module, looking at position resection using bearings and then using Bayesian analysis to compute and visualise the uncertainty in those predictions. Comparing using uniform priors that imply no pre-existing knowledge of location and applying a prior which uses open map data to assume the observations were taken from a road.
